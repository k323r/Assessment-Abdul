# Aim
The aim of this experiment is to assess noise and drift of different parameters of a sensor box that records the linear acceleration (g), angular velocity (deg/sec) and magnetic field data (micro-Tesla) depending on the motion patterns imposed on the sensor box using a robot
# Experimental setup
1.	Robot
2.	Sensor box
# Procedure
1.	Place the sensor box in the robot
2.	define the reference point
3.	Read the data from the sensor
4.	Apply filter to the data
# Potential Pitfall
# Errors in Experimental Setup
